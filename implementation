                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The wettable powder formulation of our genetically engineered <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> (the ideal strain) is a key solution for managing Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR). The wettable powder has been chosen as the most suitable application method as it is expected to give optimal results with our Biocontrol Agent (BCA), 
                </p>
                <p>Our genetically engineered <i>B. subtilis</i>, utilizing a dual-promoter system for Iturin A production, offers both preventative and curative action against CLR, unlike traditional fungicides like copper fungicides or Bordeaux mixture, which are primarily preventative.</p>
                <p><b>Preventative Action:</b> The constitutive promoter ensures continuous, baseline production of Iturin A, even before the infection starts, creating a protective barrier on coffee plants that prevents fungal spores from establishing. This provides ongoing protection without the need for constant reapplication.</p>
                <p><b>Curative Action:</b> The inducible promoter kicks in under specific environmental triggers, like infection stress, leading to a surge in Iturin A production. This rapid increase targets and disrupts existing fungal cells, effectively acting as a cure once the pathogen has infected the plant.
                </p>
                <p>Outlined below are the key aspects of the product (in comparison with existing products) including the performance metrics production methodology, formulation, application guidelines, and cost analysis of the product are stated below.
                </p>
                <p>For our implementation, cumate will be added into our formulation of wettable powder which will be taken up by our chassis passively. The formulation (chassis + Cumate) will be sprayed onto the coffee leaves in the plantation to distribute the chassis for its antifungal action against the HV. Once the Cumate has degraded or washed away the bacteria will no longer be able to survive in that environment. Cumate is a biodegradable inexpensive lab chemical. It is degraded by several microorganisms especially alphaproteobacterial like <i>Rhodococcus,Pseudomonas, and Sphingomonas</i> and is not toxic to the environment. [3][4][5]  </p>

                <h2>Performance Metrics</h2>
                
                <p>There are three major divisions of control measures currently in practice to mitigate the impact of CLR. The performance metrics of all three are presented to demonstrate the benefits of wettable powder.
                </p>
                <h3>Chemical Fungicides</h3>
                <p>The existing chemical control for Coffee Leaf Rust includes copper products (contact-preventive), systemic triazoles (preventive–curative), and systemic strobilurins (rust spore eradicator). Copper-based fungicides are very effective and have a tonic effect, but are costly and must be present on the leaf before the infection occurs. The copper accumulates in the soil, reaching levels toxic to the surrounding biome. This is an unavoidable problem, as it is necessary to have a positive charge to bind with sites capable of interfering with the fungus’s metabolism and killing it. Therefore, a suspension with 1000 L of water must contain 1.2 kg of the active ingredient Cu2+ [1]. Protective dithiocarbamate fungicides are also adequate for the control of coffee rust. However, under the heavy rains of many coffee-producing regions, their residues do not adhere as well as those of the copper-containing fungicides. H.vastatrix is genetically diverse, with more than 40 different races identified and more constantly appearing, making antifungal resistance a serious concern.
                </p>
                <p>The carboxamide molecules in use are benzovindiflupir, fluxapyroxade, and thifluzamide. The triazole molecules currently in use include cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, flutriafol, tebuconazole, and triadimenol, whereas, among others.

                <h3>Resistant cultivars</h3>
                <p>T A cross between C. arabica and C. canephora, known as Hibrido de Timor, and its derivatives, has been widely used as a resistant hybrid but isn't resistant to all races of rust. Other resistant varieties, such as robusta hybrids and arabica hybrids, are only resistant to some rust races and come with the downside of inferior cup quality. H.vastatrix is genetically diverse, with more than 40 different races identified and more constantly appearing. Due to the fungi’s rapid rate of evolution, the resistance genes of the plant have often been rendered ineffective, which, when coupled with the issues of replacing entire fields of plants and taking huge losses till they reach maturity, has rendered this method obsolete. Additionally, spreading a single resistant variety globally significantly lowers genetic diversity and increases the chance of the rust overcoming said resistance, among other long-term ecological issues.</p>

                </p>
                <h3>Agronomic practices</h3>
                <p>Sanitation, pruning, weed control, fertilization, and the regulation of shade have all been used with varying degrees of success as none significantly challenge the fungus’s survival to the required degree.
                </p>

                    <p style="padding-left: 3vh;"><b>1. Biocontrol/Microbial Agent:</b> The microbial agent must be kept under optimal conditions to ensure the desired result. Protection against chemical or physical damage during formulation is essential for maintaining its viability.</p>
                    <p style="padding-left: 3vh;"><b>2. Carriers:</b> The carrier is an inert material that evenly distributes the microbial agent. It plays the role of a solid diluent in the formulation and has no separate effect on the soil or plant environment. The optimum carrier can be considered based on the suspension rate and cost.</p>
                    <p style="padding-left: 3vh;"><b>3. Dispersants:</b>The dispersants ensure the even distribution of the powder in water or solvents, enhancing the formation of a stable dispersion. It is used to reduce solid or liquid particles in the composition dispersion system to be assembled, and when preparing wetting powder, adding dispersant makes it easy to form dispersion liquid and suspension, and keep the metastable function of dispersion.
                    </p>
                    <p style="padding-left: 3vh;"><b>4. Wetting agent:</b> The wetting agents are the surfactants that reduce the surface tension between powder and water for easy dissolution and effective application. The main function of this wetting agent is to easily soak the solid material of the composition in water/solvent. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Some wetting agents also exhibit dispersing properties, while some dispersants also have wetting capabilities. Therefore, both the suspension rate and wetting time are taken into account during the screening of dispersants and wetting agents. A higher suspension rate indicates better dispersion, while a shorter wetting time reflects better wettability. The optimal ratio is determined by assessing both factors, with the ideal combination being the one that achieves the maximum suspension rate and the shortest wetting time for the specific formulation.
                    </p>
                    <p style="padding-left: 3vh;"><b>5. Stabilizers:</b> The stabilizers contribute to making the composition a homogeneous mixture by not letting any components settle down increasing stability. It ensures the protection of microbes from oxidative damage and any environmental stress during storage, hence increasing the shelf life. It also enhances dispersion ability and adhesion to the plant leaf surface.
                    </p>
                    <p style="padding-left: 3vh;"><b>6. UV Protectant:</b> Protects the microbial agent against UV radiation when exposed to sunlight which might affect its efficacy. It also prevents the UV rays from degrading the components, preserving the integrity of all active ingredients. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following are the potential compounds or materials used as additives, and other agents required to achieve the optimum formulation for the product.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 6vh;"><b>1. Fermentation Process</b><br>After the fermentation period, the spores are harvested using centrifugation or filtration to separate them from the culture medium.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 6vh;"><b>2. Harvesting</b><br><i>Bacillus subtilis</i> is cultured in bioreactors under optimized conditions (pH 6.5-7.0, temperature 30-37°C) for 24-48 hours to induce sporulation.
                    </p>
                    <p style="padding-left: 6vh;"><b>3. Drying Process</b><br>The spore concentrate undergoes either spray drying or freeze drying to remove moisture while maintaining spore viability. </p>
                    <p style="padding-left: 6vh;"><b>4. Formulation</b><br>The dried spores are blended with inert carriers (e.g., kaolin clay or silica) to create the wettable powder formulation. Dispersing agents such as sodium lignosulfonate are added to ensure smooth suspension in water during application. Cumate (p-isopropyl benzoate) is a biodegradable, membrane-permeative chemical that can easily enter bacterial cells without transporters. It is non-toxic to Bacillus subtilis and is not known to have any negative effects on the coffee plant itself. To trigger the kill switch mechanism in the bacteria, it can be added to the wettable powder formulation in the form of methyl cumate powder.  (See Formulation in detail above)

                    <p style="padding-left: 9vh;"><b>A. Dry mixing and Addition of Additives</b><br>Dry mixing is a critical process where each component of the formulation—whether it's the active ingredient or inert materials like carriers, dispersants, or wetting agents is finely pulverized to achieve a consistent particle size. This fine powder ensures uniform distribution of all ingredients when applied or suspended in water and helps achieve homogeneity. Specific additives are incorporated to enhance the overall performance of the wettable powder.
