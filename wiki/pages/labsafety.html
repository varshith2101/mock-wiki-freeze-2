                <p>Our team places utmost importance on safety and security, prioritizing the well-being of our laboratory members, the integrity of our experiments, and environmental protection. With strong institutional backing, we have embraced our responsibility to maintain strict biosafety standards. Every experiment was carefully planned and executed with a focus on ethical practices, ensuring no harm to the environment or us. To ensure full transparency and accountability, we consulted extensively with our principal investigator before proceeding with any experiments, performing them only after receiving her approval. This approach has allowed us to uphold the highest levels of safety throughout our project.</p>

                    <h2>6. Antifungal Safety Assessment</h2>
                    <p>Iturin A is not  a hazardous substance or mixture according to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 (Sigma Aldrich) [1]. A preclinical safety assessment of the consumption of Iturin A conducted acute (7 days, 5000mg/kg BW) and subacute (28 days, 200mg/kg BW) toxicity tests through daily intragastric administrations of the stipulated amounts. The results showed no significant damage to the small intestine, liver or kidney [2]. In a second pre-clinical study, the injection of 150 mg /kg BW of Iturin A into the bloodstream of the test mice caused lethality in all of them [3]. Doses of up to 50mg/kg BW caused mild anemia and damage to only the liver and spleen, with the effects being completely reversible when exposure was discontinued  in the test mice, reflecting the dose dependent hemolytic effects of iturin that were previously reported [3]. Another study compared the effect of Iturin A in comparison to amphotericin B in treating 24-hour old <i>Candida albicans</i> infections via intraperitoneal injections. Treatment with 15mg/kg BW of Iturin per day led to the survival of all infected mice throughout the six-day duration of the study, as opposed to amphotericin B which killed all mice that it was administered to [4]. Initial clinical trials on animals and humans showed that Iturin A was effective as an antifungal, with low allergic effects and no discernable toxic effects from topical applications [5][6]. 
                        In the case of any overdose on Iturin A, potential treatments can be provided before permanent damage occurs through adding magnesium ions to or raising cholesterol levels in the bloodstream to inhibit Iturin A's activity [7][8]. </p>
                    <p>Iturin does not affect <i>D. melanogaster</i> (common fruit fly) [9], honeybees [10], and other organisms commonly found in the coffee microbiota, and it causes no harm to coffee plantations. It is larvicidal to <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito larvae [11].</p>
